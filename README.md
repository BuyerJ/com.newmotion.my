# My New Motion
Unofficial app for My New Motion. Adds support for private EV charging points found on https://my.newmotion.com.

This app is inspired on the great work of Jaime Visser's The New motion app
I rewrote the app to make it work with the private chargers from my.newmotion.com 
## What's new?
* Stable release

## Getting started
This app is focused on your own chargepoints. The once that are registered to your own account. I leave the public charge point out of the app in this first version. You also need an valid rfid card linked to your account in my new motion. The app uses your first available card.
Make sure you have a my new motion account with one chargepoint and one card connected. Then use the add device to start the wizard.

## Usage
* In the flow editor use the triggers to start a flow when someone starts/stops charging or when there are free connectors.
* TOrn on/off the chargepoint to start a charing session using your main charge card

## Supported devices
    * Private new motion charge points

## Changelog

### 2.0.0
* First release for new my.newmotion.com api's and private chargepoints
